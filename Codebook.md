##Raw Data Collection

###Collection 

Raw data are obtained from UCI Machine Learning repository. In particular we used the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, that was used by the original collectors to conduct experiments exploiting Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Activity Recognition (AR) aims to recognize the actions and goals of one or more agents from a series of observations on the agents' actions and the environmental conditions. The collectors used a sensor based approach employing smartphones as sensing tools. Smartphones are an effective solution for AR, because they come with embedded built-in sensors such as microphones, dual cameras, accelerometers, gyroscopes, etc.

The data set was built from experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.
The obtained data set has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

###Signals

The 3-axial time domain signals from accelerometer and gyroscope were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another filter. Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals. Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm. Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these time domain signals to obtain frequency domain signals.
The signals were sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window at 50 Hz). From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

* std(): Standard deviation
* mad(): Median absolute deviation
* max(): Largest value in array
* min(): Smallest value in array
* sma(): Signal magnitude area
* energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.
* iqr(): Interquartile range
* entropy(): Signal entropy
* arCoeff(): Autoregression coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
* correlation(): Correlation coefficient between two signals
* maxInds(): Index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
* meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
* skewness(): Skewness of the frequency domain signal
* kurtosis(): Kurtosis of the frequency domain signal
* bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
* angle(): Angle between some vectors.

No unit of measures is reported as all features were normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
